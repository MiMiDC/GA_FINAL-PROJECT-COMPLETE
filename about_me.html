        <p>
          Robert Gately was born on Miami Beach, the second of five children
          born to Bostonian Immigrants to South Florida. His idyllic childhood
          was marred only by school. His parents were known for their cocktail
          parties and Robert was impressed into servitude at an early age in the
          kitchen assisting in the creation of all sorts of Hors d'oeuvre and
          petit fours.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an adult his varied jobs have included a stint in the United States
          Air Force, drapery installer, computer technician for a large
          aerospace company, sales manager in an office supply store, and
          technical support representative for an Electronic Medical Record
          software company. He lives in Seattle with his super smart wife and
          two rescued terrier mix dogs, Baxter and Dylan.

      <br>GOOD RECIPES, NO SALT</h5>
    <p>
      I’m really glad to have this cookbook. In my house, we have a lot of special dietary needs, and one of those is a very low sodium diet. I *loved* the breakfast sausage patties and sausage gravy recipes, which make for an awesome weekend brunch. On a technical note, the recipes are all formatted very nicely on the kindle—they are easy to use and read.

      <br>LOVE IT!</h5>
    <p>
      While not expansive, this is a great set of recipes. My husband is on a strict low sodium diet, and the hardest thing for me is thinking of things I can cook for him. Some of our favorite dishes are in this books and I can’t wait to make the sausage gravy! Thank you so much for giving us some new items to add to our menu!

      <br>I already love</h5>
    <p>I have high blood pressure and lower sodium is one way to help with this. Now this book has some really great recipes for food I already love but they are better for you. How great is that.</p>

      <br>Great recipes</h5>
    <p>I can’t wait to try these recipes for myself. It is very hard to find salt free or low salt alternatives. High blood pressure is demanding a life change!</p>

    <h5>&#9733 &#9733 &#9733 &#9733 &#9733
      <br>A delicious culinary waltz without the salts</h5>
    <p>Our family has been trying to cut back on sodium and we were pleased to discover this Kindle recipe book. Rather than an overwhelming slew of recipes, Robert 'Bob' and Brooke, provide classic 'American' kitchen classics with a fraction of the sodium. These are family friendly staples (green bean casserole, tetrazinni and stroganoff) with a few international spices thrown in - can't wait to try the indian butter chicken and biryani! The finale, Chicken Pot Pie looks incredible .&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbspperhaps their kitchen is open for guests?</p>

      <br>Low sodium comfort food</h5>
    <p>My husband needs to cut back on his sodium intake and this book was a pleasant surprise for my meat and potatoes man. The recipes aren't any more complicated than regular cooking, and I was introduced to salt substitutes and spice blends that I can use in my other cooking. We found the Chicken Biryani and Steak and Sweet Potato Stew to be flavorful and easy!</p>
