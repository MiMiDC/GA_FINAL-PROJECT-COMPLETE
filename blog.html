        <p>
          In November of 2008, my doctor, in conjunction with an Ear Nose and
          Throat specialist (otolaryngologist), an audiologist, and an MRI,
          diagnosed me with Ménière’s disease. Ménière’s disease is a condition
          of the inner ear which affects hearing, balance and essentially makes
          you seasick while motionless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ménière’s disease is usually diagnosed by the elimination of several
          other conditions that could cause the symptoms that plague me.
          Periodic episodes of rotary vertigo or dizziness, progressive and
          unilateral (in one ear) hearing loss, and unilateral tinnitus can be
          caused by things as simple as noise damage to the inner ear or by
          something more complex like cysts on the cochlea. But if the symptoms
          occur in conjunction with one another, a probable diagnosis is
          Ménière’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          There really is no treatment aside from the radical removal of the
          inner ear. But that procedure is normally reserved for severe
          sufferers who also are plagued by ‘drop attacks’, a sudden, severe
          attack of dizziness or vertigo that causes the sufferer, if not
          seated, to fall. Thankfully, in the four years since my initial
          diagnosis, I have not progressed anywhere near a level of that
          severity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most patients are advised to adopt a low-sodium diet, typically one to
          two grams (1000-2000mg) at first, but diets as low as 400mg are not
          uncommon. I initially tailored my diet by aiming in the 1000 through
          1500 milligram per day range since I was advised that this could be
          beneficial. But have since modified that to something more like 800
          through 1200 milligrams per day. This treatment is really aimed at
          prevention, and I have noticed that it appears to be an effective
          treatment for me, and in the long run it can’t be anything other than
          beneficial from a heart health standpoint.
        </p>
        <h4 class="about-h4">The Challenge</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the challenges involved in transitioning to a low-sodium diet
          are obvious to all. Fast foods, pre-packaged foods, and most snack
          foods are all richly laden with not only calories and fats, but with
          sodium as well. That Whopper® with Cheese at Burger King? A whopping
          1450 milligrams of sodium, is more than my daily requirement and that
          is not including the large fries, they are an additional 990
          milligrams.
        </p>
        <p>
          How about a nice piece of pizza? Let’s use the ubiquitous Pizza Hut as
          an example. A serving of their 14-inch pepperoni pan pizza is 850
          milligrams of sodium. That’s almost reasonable, right? Not for me!
          Their serving is 1 slice of pie. Who can eat only one slice of
          pepperoni pizza? Even a pizza as wooden as Pizza Hut demands at least
          two slices, and that alone puts me far over the top at 1700
          milligrams. I can’t even consider having breakfast or lunch if I want
          that single slice of pizza for dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, sometimes you have little choice in where and what you eat.
          Trying to get a nutritious, low-sodium meal in an airport can be very
          difficult to say the least. Grabbing a quick meal on a road trip is
          fraught with danger at almost every turn. But, keeping that in mind I
          can plan on ordering the least dangerous menu offering and try to make
          it up to my poor ears the next day. Using the previously mentioned
          Burger King menu I can order a WHOPPER JR.® Sandwich (no cheese) and a
          small order of fries with no salt and come away with only a 940
          milligram intake. That doesn’t leave much of my daily allotment, but a
          simple salad with a piece of grilled chicken and an oil and vinegar
          dressing for dinner will keep me under.
        </p>
        <h4 class="about-h4">The Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          My day to day solutions for a low-sodium diet include menu planning,
          weekly shopping excursions to the local fruit and vegetable market, as
          well as the grocery store, and portion control. These things have
          allowed me to get a firm grip on my sodium intake and manage it on a
          day to day and meal to meal basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of sodium management as a ‘cure’ for Ménière’s is
          preventative in nature and it was hard to tell if I’d been having an
          effect when you consider that I only had 1-2 incidents a year.
          However, except for an emotionally stressful week in the summer of
          2011, I’ve been vertigo free for a couple of years. So I’m convinced
          that, generally, this is the cure for me.
